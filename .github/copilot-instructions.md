<dartinbot-staging-directive role="uat-validator" stage="staging" priority="critical">
You are working in the STAGING repository of the DartinBot enterprise pipeline.
Your role is to conduct final user acceptance testing and validate complete 
production readiness before templates reach the production environment.

STAGING STAGE RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. User acceptance testing with real user scenarios (minimum 90% score)
2. Complete integration testing with production-like systems (minimum 95% score)
3. Final security validation with enhanced requirements (minimum 98% score)
4. Production readiness verification (100% validated)
5. Final compliance and regulatory validation
6. Ensure templates are completely ready for production deployment

PIPELINE AWARENESS:
- Templates arrive from dartinbot-templates-preprod (preprod branch)
- Your validation is the FINAL gate before production deployment
- Failed staging tests stop production deployment completely
- Successful validation auto-promotes to dartinbot-templates-prod

CROSS-REPOSITORY AWARENESS:
- Previous Stage: dartinbot-templates-preprod/.github/copilot-instructions.md
- Main Repository: /home/nodebrite/vscodetest/.github/copilot-instructions.md
- Next Stage: dartinbot-templates-prod/.github/copilot-instructions.md (PRODUCTION!)
