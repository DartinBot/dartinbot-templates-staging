# DartinBot Templates - Staging

This repository manages the staging environment where templates undergo final validation and production environment simulation before production deployment.

## 🎯 Staging Environment Focus

### Production Environment Simulation
- **Production Mirroring**: Exact production environment replication
- **Final Validation**: Last validation before production deployment
- **Deployment Rehearsal**: Complete production deployment simulation
- **Monitoring Validation**: Production monitoring and alerting validation
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Final user acceptance validation

### Quality Standards for Staging
- **Production Parity**: 100% production environment simulation
- **Performance Validation**: Production-level performance requirements
- **Monitoring Coverage**: Complete monitoring and alerting setup
- **Deployment Success**: 100% deployment rehearsal success
- **Zero Regressions**: No functional or performance regressions

5. **Monitoring Validation**: All monitoring and alerting functional

### 3. Deployment Rehearsal
1. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Practice zero-downtime deployment
2. **Canary Deployment**: Gradual rollout simulation
3. **Rollback Procedures**: Test rollback and recovery procedures
4. **Database Migration**: Practice database schema changes
5. **Configuration Management**: Validate configuration deployment

### 4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
1. **Business Scenario Testing**: Real business use case validation
2. **User Experience Testing**: User interface and experience validation
3. **Performance Acceptance**: User-perceived performance validation
